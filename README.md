A simple console-based Calendar and Event Management System built in C++ using linked lists.
This project allows users to view a yearly calendar, add events, update them, delete events and display all scheduled events.

Features involve: 
Yearly Calendar Display – Generates and displays the full calendar for a given year.
Add Event – Add event name and description for a specific date.
Update Event – Modify event details for an existing date.
Delete Event – Remove an event from the calendar.
Display All Events – View all events currently stored.
Dynamic Linked List Implementation – Efficiently manages dates and events.

How It Works:
Input a year → The program generates the calendar month by month.
Menu options allow you to:
Add an event, Update an event, View all events, Delete an event and  Exit the program.
Uses Zeller's Congruence to determine the day of the week for each date.
